# sp500_predicition_10models
 this project focuses on analyzing data related to S&amp;P 500 stocks and aims to predict their future performance using a combination of value and momentum indicators. we  applies different models to assess the effectiveness of these indicators in predicting stock performance.
The target variable for prediction is the 1-month performance following the momentum periods. This means the author aims to predict how a stock will perform in the month after certain momentum periods based on the selected indicators.

To compare the performance of different approaches, the author applies various models to the dataset. It's likely that the author uses machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, or ensemble methods to build predictive models.
